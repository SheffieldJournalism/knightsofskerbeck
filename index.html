    <p> Located in Boston, Lincolnshire is the headquarters of the Knights of Skirbeck, a medieval re-enactment society who depict the life of a noble household in fifteenth century England, more specifically the reign of the House of Lancaster from 1399-1471.</p>

<section class="content">

<p>Although the group focus on this area of history, they do not re-enact specific events. They simply show what life was like for people living in a noble, military based house during this time. </p>

<p>Members of the group are also free to take on their own characters and re-enact other periods of time as long as they are authentic to the specific period and are executed to a high standard. This is something that they call ‘first-person living history’. </p>

<p>The Skirbeck house, which was formed in 2008 by three experienced re-enactors, now has 26 active members in total. </p>

<p>Their growth over the last decade has led to a lot of media attention in recent years. The group have appeared on the BBC’s The One Show and in films such as Gangsters, Guns and Zombies and Outlaw. </p>

<p>More recently, Noisey made a documentary about the group called ‘Big Narstie: The Real Game of Thrones’, in which British grime artist Big Narstie spends some time with the group and attends one of their shows.</p>


<p>The reason behind Big Narstie’s visit to Boston is for him to live out his Game of Thrones dreams of medieval nobility and warfare. </p>

<blockquote class="wow slideInLeft" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: slideInLeft;">
    He’s a funny guy. He turned up at the front door and said ‘Hi I’m Narstie’. I replied ‘Really?! You look nice enough to me!’<br> ~ <em>Ser Bryan of Skirbeck ~</em>
</blockquote>

<p>“Big Narstie being from Brixton, he speaks the London dialect. Whereas we speak rural Lincolnshire dialect, so there was quite a lot of translating going on at points.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the documentary and I really like it! There’s no such thing as a bad publicity. I don’t think that it paints us in bad light, which was my biggest fear.</p>

<p>“I worried that they would make it a ‘come and look at the loony’s’ type of documentary, but it isn’t. I think this is because Big Narstie fully embraced re-enactment. I’ll never forget the excitement on his face when he fired a cannon at the Tatton Park show. He was in his element!".</p>

<p>This is a key goal for the Knights of Skirbeck. They want people to come into their group and have a good time. They also want members of the public to say that they have helped them step back in time.</p>

<p>Big Narstie understood the group because in his world everybody wears the same clothes and listen to the same music etc. The re-enactment world is completely the same. Everybody listens to the same medieval music, wears the same medieval clothes and everybody shares a love for sword fighting.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="content">

<p> As already mentioned, there are 26 members in the Knights of Skirbeck group and they are all free to take on any role or narrative that they please.</p>

<p> At the top of the household are the knights. There are currently five knights in the Skirbeck group and one member of the militia is also training to be a knight.</p>

            </div>
              </div>



              <p>Below the knights are the militia and the men at arms. People who take these roles tend to be less skilled or experienced fighters than knights, although they can become knights by passing the spurs test.</p>


        <div class="flex_container">
                  <div class=container>
                <img src="images/daniel.png" style="width:100%" class="image" alt="">

            </div>
              </div>
          </div>


<p> Some of the other roles in the group include cooks, cleaners, squires and musicians. However, in the Knights of Skirbeck everybody is on the same level. No member or role is more important than any other.</p>

<div class="flex_container">
    <div class=container>

<div class="middle">
<div class="smalltext">David Brown, member of the militia</div>

</div>
  </div>

<p> This is just one way in which Ser Bryan ensures that inclusion in the group is always high. Inclusivity is an extremely important thing for him, as he believes that making sure everyone feels comfortable in the group is the key to their success.</p>

<blockquote class="wow slideInLeft" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: slideInLeft;">
    As long as you muck in and have fun we don’t care. This makes me really happy; I love the fact that we are completely non-judgmental.<br> ~ <em>Ser Bryan of Skirbeck ~</em>
</blockquote>

   <p> Like the famous Stark family from Game of Thrones, the Knights of Skirbeck have also introduced two wolves (kind of) to their group. Buster and Castiel are just normal husky dogs by day, but when the Knights have a show to attend they become the group's loyal wolves.</p>

      <div class="flex_container">
                <div class=container>
              <img src="images/ghost.jpg" style="width:100%" class="image" alt="">
              <div class="middle">
              <div class="smalltext"> Buster, a Skirbeck wolf </div>
            </div>

              <div class=container>
            <img src="images/castiel.jpg" style="width:100%" class="image" alt="">
            <div class="middle">

          </div>
            </div>
        </div>

     <p> The group may be one of the most inclusive on the re-enactment scene, but they're certainly not the most authentic, and Ser Bryan accepts this.</p>

     <p> “We’re not the most authentic group in the world, as we don’t re-enact specific events.</p>

       <p> “You have to be able to play the part of a 15th century person living in a noble household. That’s our authenticity standard. Our arena shows are entertaining as well as educational, as we love to be able to explain to people that a lot of what people think happened in the middle ages is actually not true."</p>

    <section id="weapons" class="gaunt image_bg">
  <h4 class="wow zoomIn"> Their arsenal </h4>
    </section>
    <section class="content">
      <p>The Knights of Skirbeck use a wide variety of weapons and armour in battle - from an axe to a cannon. However, the most commonly used weapon across the group is a single-handed arming sword.</p>
      <p> A typical, entry-level arming sword will put you out of pocket by around £150. The members of the Skirbeck group do not only invest a large amount of their time and effort into re-enactment, they also spend a ton of money on equipment and shows.</p>

      <p> Ser Bryan averagely spends around £200 on each sword and his most expensive one cost £360. However, he notes that you only pay these prices for top level equipment. Many people buy swords that are priced much cheaper at around £50.</p>

      <p> This is a dangerous move in Ser Bryan's view, as this equipment is likely to give you little protection in battle and is prone to break. He always advises his group members to shell out for the most expensive gear, as this is the stuff that will keep you safe.</p>

      <p> Ser Bryan states that for him and his group re-enactment has gone much further than a hobby, it is a way of life. He has invested thousands of pounds in order to keep the group going, but he believes that the more you spend the more fun you have. </p>
      <blockquote class="wow slideInLeft" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: slideInLeft;">
        If you look around our house, you would find medieval equipment on every wall.<br> ~ <em>Ser Bryan of Skirbeck ~</em>

      <p> Below are some of the weapons that the Knights of Skirbeck use to attack their opponents...</p>

<section class="content">
  <p> Besides weapons, protective equipment, such as full plate armour, is also extremely important for the Knights of Skirbeck.</p>
  <p> A good set of armour is likely to cost you around £2000. However, like with swords, people often try to take shortcuts and purchase cheap armour online.</p>
  <p> Ser Bryan states that he would deter anyone from purchasing cheap armour, as it is likely to get you hurt on the battlefield. Aside from this, cheap armour is also very difficult to fight in, as it is very stiff and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p> Re-enactment shows are also very expensive for the group to organise and run, as most shows last for 2-3 days. The Knights of Skirbeck did 22 shows last year, but they have reduced that number this year by a significant amount, as the costs became too much for Ser Bryan.</p>
   <p> A typical Knights of Skirbeck show includes an authentic medieval encampment consisting of 10-15 tents. You will be welcomed to come in and explore the environment. There will be a fully stocked armoury where members of the group will invite you to try on armour and use weapons. There will also be a working kitchen where Alice Puddy will be cooking the food for the day.</p>
   <p>Throughout the day, there will be pre-staged incidents that take place, such as somebody may rush over complaining about a wound on his arm. Alice, who is also a physician, will inspect the problem in front of the audience, who will be able to see a dozen maggots wriggling around the wound.</p>
   <p> Alice will then clean the wound up and remove the maggots. In order to clean the wound up fully she will cauterize it. She will get a red hot iron out of the fire and place it on the wound. It smokes and sizzles six feet away from the audience, before she places the iron in a cold bucket of water.</p>
   <p> Sir Bryan will also hold a manorial court hearing if he’s feeling arrogant. He will have people brought to him for various offences. A favourite of the Skirbeck group is to get a female member of the audience and accuse her of being a witch. Sir Bryan will then carry out a scientific test to see if she is in fact a witch.</p>
   <p> He does this by looking through a hag stone, a stone which has a hole through the middle of it. According to myth, a witch can disguise as an attractive lady, but if you look at her through a hag stone you can see her real identity. Sir Bryan gets his hag stone and looks at the member of the audience.</p>
   <p> However, the moment he looks at her, one of the male members of the group steps in front of her. Therefore, all Sir Bryan can see through his hag stone is an ugly man so he screams out “She’s a witch”.</p>
   <p> The map below shows where the Knights of Skirbeck attend events across the country...</p>

<section class="content">
<p> The Knights of Skirbeck also want their shows to be educational. After all the silliness is finished, they will show the audience the various types of weapons that they use and how to use them. They prove that these weapons are sharp by peeling apples with them. However, they also show the audience the blunt weapons that are used for tournaments and battles.</p>

  <p>This is authentic as blunted weapons have been used in tournament fights since the start of the 13th century. They show the difference between sharp and blunted swords.</p>

<p> The finale of a show is usually a tournament. The group get a few junior combatants and they take part in a competitive fight. The audience decides the winner and then they move onto another tournament where more senior fighters compete in what they call full contact sword fighting. The group ensure all members of this tournament where full-plate armour so that they don’t receive any serious blows.</p>
<p> Sword fighting is an extremely tiring and physically demanding sport. Ser Bryan, who is the oldest tournament fighter in the country, lost a final a couple of years ago to one of the groups other members, Ser John Deere, purely because he a lot more stamina than him. </p>

<p> At 53, Ser Bryan is struggling to keep up with the demands of re-enactment life. He feels that he should retire in the near future, but he fears what implications this could have on the future of the Skirbeck group. </p>
<p> He discusses the future of the Knights of Skirbeck in the video below...</p>
